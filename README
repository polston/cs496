CS496 Project Repository

To run:
Install nodejs and npm (both should be bundled in the installer if you're on windows)
(https://nodejs.org/en/ use 7.4 or 6.whatever, it doesn't/shouldn't actually matter)

Also install mongodb and follow their instructions on how to start it.
windows: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=starting+mongodb+on+windows
osx: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=starting+mongodb+on+osx
The first link you get is probably the right one.

If you're on cloud9, follow these instructions to set up mongodb (literally copy/paste them into the terminal):
https://community.c9.io/t/setting-up-mongodb/1717

Navigate to the project directory via the terminal.

While in the terminal inside the project directory type:
**npm install

This will install all of the packages and dependencies indicated by the package.json file.

You will also need to install bower type:
**npm install -g bower

Then type:
**bower install

This will install the bower dependencies located in bower.json

*Optionally\* *in the terminal type:
**npm install -g nodemon

While still in the directory, in the terminal type:
**node app.js
**Or, if you followed the optional route type:
**nodemon app.js

This will start the server.

Go to your browser and naviate to *localhost:4000.
*Or, if you're on cloud9, click *preview>running application*, and copy that url and put it into another tab for reference

The views/landing.ejs will be rendered.



**NOTE:
\* Not actually optional, because it saves so much time nodemon restarts the server every time a .js file is changed(saved).
